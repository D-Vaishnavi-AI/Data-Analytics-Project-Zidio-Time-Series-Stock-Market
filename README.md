# Data Analytics Project Zidio Time Series Stock Market
# üìã Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast stock market trends using advanced time series analysis techniques. Interns will explore a variety of statistical and machine learning models to gain insights from historical financial data, identify trends, seasonality, and patterns, and make both short-term and long-term predictions.
This hands-on project provides real-world experience in financial data analytics, model development, and performance evaluation.

# üéØ Objectives
Perform exploratory analysis on historical stock market data
Understand and visualize time series components: trend, seasonality, and noise
Apply and compare multiple forecasting models including:
  ARIMA / SARIMA
  Facebook Prophet
  LSTM (Deep Learning)
Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics
Interpret results to inform decision-making
(Optional) Deploy the best-performing model on a simple web dashboard

# üì¶ Key Features
Time Series Decomposition
Stationarity Testing and Differencing
Model Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning
Forecast Visualization
Residual & Error Analysis

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statsmodels (ARIMA/SARIMA)
Facebook Prophet
TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
(Optional) Streamlit / Flask for web deployment

# Outcomes
By the end of this project, interns will:
Gain a strong foundation in time series forecasting
